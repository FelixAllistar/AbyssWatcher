title: '[UI/Core] outgoing DPS weapon-to-target breakdown'
description: On outgoing dps, we should have it as a dropdown per weapon to see the enemy its attacking if there are multiple hits, or just inline the target name somehow if its only 1 target. some weapons are AoE some are single target, and sometimes we might have multiple damage events due to lag. so im not sure how to handle this. maybe have a WeaponDMGEvent component that can be either a dropdown or not depending on events its given.

title: '[Core] Fix data sync between card totals and top summary'
description: the totals on character cards arent showing the same numbers that it does at the top row totals, like some some character cards get 'stuck for a while and enver go away. its like sometimes they all add up. even waiting a while after combat ending they are still up despite a 1s interval. the numbers on the very top are still the same and right. where do the cards get their data and how can it be different than the top?

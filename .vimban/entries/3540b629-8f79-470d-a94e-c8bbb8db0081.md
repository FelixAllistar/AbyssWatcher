title: '[UI] Implement nested scrolls in CombatBreakdown'
description: work on scroll container for live overlay window, when its small and i expand a character i cant scroll down to see stuff. it does seem to work like that on replay suite but im not 100% sure. we need to double check and plan well because we'd kinda need nested scroll views because they could have 20 characters each with their own row, and then expanding them to have content inside of it...

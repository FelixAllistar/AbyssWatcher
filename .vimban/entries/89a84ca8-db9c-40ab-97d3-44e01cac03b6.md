title: rework core rust logic on weapon parsing to account for logi
description: |-
  sometimes we have logs like 128 remote shield/armor boosted by PLAYER NAME and we need to account for that seperately from the actual DPS logic because right now its acting like thats dps. the pattern is NUMBER remote, and then it can be shield/armor/capacitor. the hard part is figuring out how to get the player name. it might be from after the by or the stuff inside brackets. here is an example log but it can be setup differently: 23:00:34Combat39 remote shield boosted by  Hawk [CARII]  [Felix Allistar] - - Gistii A-Type Small Remote Shield Booster
  23:00:32Combat0 remote shield boosted to  Hawk [CARII]  [Felix Allistar] - - Gistii A-Type Small Remote Shield Booster             that s 2 lines of incoming and outgoing shield boosters, but it could be armor repaired or remote capacitor transferred. we want to track all 3 both incoming and outgoing, so we'll have incoming/outgoing dps, shield/armor/hull, and capacitor
